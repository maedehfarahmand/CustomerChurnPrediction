# Telecom Churn Analysis

This repository contains an end-to-end data analysis project, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning models, and data visualization using Power BI.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Conducted an in-depth analysis of the Telecom Churn dataset to uncover patterns and insights.  
   - Visualizations and summary statistics are included in `EDA.ipynb`.  

2. **Machine Learning Models:**  
   - **Decision Tree Classification:** Implemented to predict customer churn based on features in `DecisionTree.ipynb`.  
   - **Clustering:** Applied clustering techniques to segment customers based on features such as usage behavior and churn likelihood, detailed in `Clustering.ipynb`.  

3. **Power BI Dashboard:**  
   - Created a visualization dashboard to present key insights derived from the dataset and machine learning models in `PowerBIAnalysis.pbix`.

## Dataset
